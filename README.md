# Smart Parking System


## Smart Parking System using Arduino

This project is a smart Parking system, obtains information about available parking spaces and process in real-time to place vehicles at available positions,It involves using low-cost sensors, real-time data collection, and provides automatic pricing & payment and security.


## Smart Parking System consists of :

### 1- Parking System

- Detect the availability of parking spaces using IR sensors
- Display the number of available parking spaces using LCD
- Automatically open or close entrance, exit, and parking spaces gates depending on available parking spaces
- Show if the parking space is available or not using LED


### 2- Automatic Pricing & Payment System

- Automatically calculate the price per time of parking
- Open parking space and exit gates after payment using keypad


### 3- Fire Alarm

- Activate an alarm when detecting fire using flame sensor

### 4- Light Control System

- Detect the presence or the light level using Light dependent resistor LDR to light the parking automatically and efficiently
